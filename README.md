# IBM Course Basics

## Python pandas basics
From IBM course, I am learning about pandas and data frames.

In this lab, I analyze unemployment and GDP data provided by the course by creating a data frame via pandas. 
I show ability to select and identify specifics types of data that I need, and I also create a dashboard that 
visualizes the various data from the dataframe. 

## SQL basics
Learning the basics of querying large data and getting intended data. 
In this module, I analyzed Chicago's schools, crime statistics, and census data to obtain basic information.
